SleepyHead v1.0 branch

SleepyHead is cross platform, opensource sleep tracking program for reviewing CPAP and Oximetry data, 
which are devices used in the treatment of Sleep Disorders like Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

Requirements:
-------------
Qt5 SDK with webkit (Qt5.5 from http://qt.io/download-open-source recommended)
Linux needs libudev-dev for qserialport to compile

OSX needs Xcode and commandline tools from AppStore

Windows needs MinGW (in Qt5 SDK) or VC++2013 Express (and matching Qt libraries)

Building:
--------

Recommend shadow building to not cruft up the source code folder:

cd ..
mkdir build_sleepyhead
cd build_sleepyhead
qmake ../sleepyhead-code/SleepyHeadQT.pro 
make

You may need to add a -spec option to qmake to suit your platform. 
Adding -j3 speeds up the make command on a dual core or greater system.
