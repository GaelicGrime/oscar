SleepyHead alpha test build.. 

This is nowhere near an official release, and is 100% Guaranteed to break when you least expect it.

This "mini alpha version" only currently supports Philips Respironics system one machines and Contec CMS50 Oximeters. 

It's just a tool I wrote based on our SleepLib framework to track my CPAP data, and I thought I'd share it for those who are game while we work on the real app.

Just a heads up, it creates a SleepApp folder in your documents folder. This is where it stores it's database.

To use, Click File -> Import SD and select your SD card folder (or a copy of it). 

I'm hoping the rest is self explanitory, click on things.. See how well it breaks.
