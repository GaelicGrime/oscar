      <hr />
      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>
      <p>OSCAR is a derivitive of the SleepyHead program written by Mark Watkins, during the years 2011 to 2018. The current project is the combined effort of people from CPAPtalk.com, ApneaBoard.com, and other volunteers, starting in 2019.</p>
      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>
      <p><span style=" font-weight:600;">OpenSource Libraries</span></p>
      <p>OSCAR uses the OpenSource version of the Qt cross platform toolkit available from <a href="http://qt.io"><span style=" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">http://qt.io</span></a> which itself draws from many smaller open source libraries. You can read the individual licensing for many of these components that are used under the hood of OSCAR at <a href="http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.7/3rdparty.html"><span style=" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-5.7/3rdparty.html</span></a></p>
      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>
      <p><span style=" font-weight:600;">Data formats</span></p>
      <p>Because the CPAP machine data formats are mostly undocumented and getting them working in OSCAR involved a lot of hacking, Mark Watkins needed a lot of SD card data samples, and patient users willing to put up with crashes and wonky data, and plenty of help from fellow hackers out there who shared in the workload of decoding data formats. Thanks to all of you who have helped in the fight to protect our right to keep our own data open and accessible!</p>
      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>

      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>
      <p>For OSCAR to come to you in the form you see it in now, it took a lot more work than just that of the project's original creator <a href="http://jedimark.net"><span style=" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">Jedimark</span></a>. The following are the Credits from the last version of SleepyHead.</p>
      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>
      <p><span style=" font-weight:600;">Patches, bugfixes and platform support</span></p>
      <p><span style=" color:#000000;">James Marshall, Rich Freeman, John Masters, Keary Griffin, Patricia Shanahan, Alec Clews, manders99, Sean Stangl, Roy Stone, François Revol, Michael Masterson, RezNet, JediBob, Pholy and names I'm sure I've missed or yet to add.</span></p>
      <p style="-qt-paragraph-type:empty;"><br /></p>
      <p><span style=" font-weight:600;">Language and Translation</span></p>
      <p><span style=" color:#000000;">Now with sixteen (!) new languages besides English (US) it is important to mention all those people who have done an enormous job breaking their heads over 1566 strings with 9572 words, making a total of over 56.000 characters, for the original SleepyHead Version 1.0.0<br /></span></p>
      <p><span style=" color:#000000;">The translation team was: Arie Klerk (Translation Coordinator, also Dutch), Steffen Reitz (German), Chen Hao (Chinese), Lars-Erik Söderström (Swedish), Damien Vigneron (French), António Jorge Costa (Portuguese), Judith Guzmán (Spanish), Plamen Tonev (Bulgarian), Johan Heikkilä (Finnish), Boguslaw Kucharski (Polish), Luca Roberti (Italian), Iohannis Nasef (Greek and Arabic), Heyns van der Merwe (African), Jason Williams (English UK) and Yaron Keren (Hebrew).</span></p>
      <p><span style=" color:#000000;"><br />Any remarks can be sent to Arie Klerk, who will attempt to put you in contact with the translator.</span></p>
      <p><span style=" color:#000000;"><br /></span><span style=" font-weight:600; color:#000000;">Special Mentions<br /></span><span style=" color:#000000;">A big thanks (again) to Arie Klerk for tirelessly filling the role of SleepyHead's Translation coordinator and helping get SleepyHead out of it's monolingual rut, and fit and ready to be shared with a much wider audience around the world.<br /></span></p>
      <p<span style=" color:#000000;">Special thanks to Pugsy and Robysue from </span><a href="http://cpaptalk.com"><span style=" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">CPAPTalk</span></a><span style=" color:#000000;"> for their help with documentation and tutorials, as well as everyone who helped out by testing and sharing their CPAP data.<br /><br />Thanks to CPAPTalk's host </span><a href="http://CPAP.com"><span style=" text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;">CPAP.com</span></a><span style=" color:#000000;"> for their generous donations, and letting me run amock in the early days and pester their forums users for help to test SleepyHead. </span></p>
