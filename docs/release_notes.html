<p><b>Problems & Stuff?</b><br/>

<p>SourceForge is still the best place to report bugs, especially to do with these binary builds. If your following GIT source, they mailing list is (usually) much quicker in getting my attention.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you experience a crash right after starting this new version, you may need to manually remove the old "SleepApp" folder, which resides under your documents directory.</p>
<p><b>Thanks</b><br/>
Thanks to all the wonderful people who have given their support to this project, be it via donations,
sharing CPAP data, following GIT source tree, testing binary builds, submitting bug reports, giving ideas for improvement, and general feedback on the CPAP forums.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate all the help and encouragement.</p>
<p>Sleep Well,</p>
