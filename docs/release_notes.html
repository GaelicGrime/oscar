<h1><image src='qrc:/docs/sheep.png' width=64 height=64>SleepyHead v0.8.8</h1>

<p><b>Please Note:</b> <i>This is STILL pre-Beta software. Expect bugs. but less than before :)</i></p>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>

<p>Getting a lot more substantial...</p>

<p><b>Oximetry Special</b></br>
<li>Complete rewrite of Oximetery Tab, it's now (hopefully) working much better.</li>
<li>If you start the oximeters record mode and switch on CPAP at exactly the same time, you can now get reasonable sync without needing the USB cable, provided you <b>import your CPAP data before oximetry.</b></li>
<li>Oximetry PulseChange & SPO2Drop event flagging.. (Options in Preferences)
<li>A re-indexing feature to re-apply different flagging rules without messing up imported oximetry data.</li>
<li>Clock problems with Live serial CMS50 recording fixed.</li>

<p>Note: Nothing has been done to the SpO2Review importer module.</p>

<p><b>What else's New?</b><br/>
<li>DeVilbiss Intellipap Support.. not perfect yet, but needs testing..</li>
<li>New Graph tab in Preferences for changing individual graph settings, visibility, etc.</li>
<li>Graph settings are now persistant.. It will remember sizes and graph orders for you.</li>
<li>Rewritten Print Support. Can now print reports in Daily View, Overview and Oximetry. You can hide graphs you don't want to print.</li>
<li>New Respiratory Rate, Tidal Volume and Minute Ventilation graphs for PRS1 users, extracted from the flow waveform.</li>
<li>Bookmark feature for daily view, each day has it's own set of bookmarks.</li>
<li>Weight, BMI calcs, and Zombie-Meter added to Daily View's Notes tab.. Plus related Overview Graphs.</li>
<li>Daily View's Details panel has a few useful tooltips (showing description & units) and some clickable links.</li>
<li>Import now offers to remember your locations.. There is a preferences area to edit this list.</li>
<li>Can now change how much data is shown around events selected in the Event List, by dragging the slider underneath.</li>
<li>Preference option to Skip Login Window</li>
<li>Change User (logout) option in the File menu</li>
<li>Quite a few other little bugfixes I've forgotten about.</li>

<b>NOTE:</b> For best results, <b>start fresh this time by deleting your SleepApp folder</b> (which is in your Documents directory) otherwise unpredictable things can happen..

There has simply been too many changes this time to keep up with the old data format..

<br/>
<b>What's still missing/broken?</b><br/>
<li>The printed reports still need some details and fine tuning.</li>
<li>The mask tab in preferences is just a placeholder for future calculations</li>
<li>Plenty of bugs. there's a lot of new code this time..</li>
</p>
<p><b>Problems & Stuff?</b><br/>
<p>SourceForge is still the best place to report bugs, especially to do with these binary builds. If your following GIT source, they mailing list is (usually) much quicker in getting my attention.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you experience a crash right after starting this new version, you may need to manually remove the old "SleepApp" folder, which resides under your documents directory.</p>
<p><b>Thanks</b><br/>
Thanks to all the wonderful people who have given their support to this project, be it via donations,
sharing CPAP data, following GIT source tree, testing binary builds, submitting bug reports, giving ideas for improvement, and general feedback on the CPAP forums.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate all the help and encouragement.</p>
<p>Sleep Well,</p>
<p>Mark Watkins (JediMark)</p>
