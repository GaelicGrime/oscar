<h1><image src='qrc:/docs/sheep.png' width=64 height=64>SleepyHead v0.9.0 <b>BETA</b></h1>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p><i>Beta.. Hooray.. I know it doesn't feel much different :)</i></p>
<p>What does this mean for SleepyHead you ask? It means now the primary focus has been shifted away from design to smashing bugs.</p>
<p>SleepyHead's database (SleepLib) has had it's final work done on it, and is officially locked. Any changes made from now on will require a full upgrade path.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it means starting fresh for this series, however the good news is this version can coexist with the old one while you copy your notes over.</p>
<p>There is still some stuff to do, but apart from bug-fixing, it's mostly cosmetic and easy stuff from now on in.</p>
<p><b>New Features:</b></br>
<list>
<li>Auto-Updater for Windows & Mac Platforms</li>
<li>SleepLib database improvements, and lots of other underneath stuff, code cleanups and optimisations you don't see.</li>
<li>Session Hiding capabilities, by clicking on the toggle button down the bottom of Daily views details panel</li>
<li>New Statistics page showing some more useful data.</li>
<li>Prescription Settings list in statistics shows recent machine settings changes, and jumps to overview when clicked on</li>
<li>Welcome page has become a Help Browser.</li>
<li>New Navigation Panel on the right side, now accessible from all tabs. It can be hidden to reclaim screen space.</li>
<li>New Bookmarks tab in this right panel for showing days with bookmarks, allowing you to quickly jump to them.</li>
<li>New Records tab to show some best/worst entries, which have links going directly to the related day or overview range.</li>
<li>Daily (printed) reports show oximetry data when showing bookmarks.</li>
<li>Can print from both the Statistics & Help Browser pages.</li>
<li>Option to automatically maintain backup folder for ResMed users. (on by default)</li>
<li>Compression options to save disk space for SleepyHead data and backups.</li>
<li>Rewritten Flow Rate Calculations Module gives MinuteVent, RespiratoryRate, TidalVolume, Te & Ti to machines where it's missing, (provided Flow Waveform is available) and is much more accurate than before.</li>
<li>New Context cube to make empty pages more attractive.. Yes you can switch it off. No it doesn't take much resources.</li>
<li>Plenty of other bug fixes, including more oximetry fixes.</li>
</list></p>
<p><b>Important Information:</b><br/>
<list>
<li>Just to repeat, SleepyHead can't work with the older database format. I tried to make it update, but it didn't go to plan. Sorry.</li>
<li>SleepApp has now been renamed to SleepyHeadData, it still resides in your Documents folder so it's easy to find.</li>
</list></p>
<p><b>Planned Improvements for this beta series:</b><br/>
The hard stuffs done, and everything needs time to settle and have the bugs knocked out of it, however there still are some minor tweaks and features in the pipeline...</p>
<list>
<li>Lots more Performance Optimizations</li>
<li>Graphical tweaks, animations & improvements</li>
<li>Improving the quality of printed report data, and showing more data and statistics.</li>
<li>Improving the CSV export feature, and making it more customizable</li>
</list>
<i>But mostly we are talking serious bug smashing time!!!</i>
</p>
<p><b>Problems & Stuff?</b><br/>
SourceForge is still the best place to report bugs, and this is especially important now we have reached beta. If your following GIT source, the mailing list is still a quicker way of getting my attention.</p>
<p><b>Thanks</b><br/>
Thanks to all of you for the wonderful support you've given, by testing the software, reporting bugs, sharing your data, giving kind words of encouragement, monetary donations, and all the cool suggestions on how to make this project even better. </p>
<p>Special thanks to James M. (BreatheJimbo), who has been a huge help in getting things solid, espescially for Apple Mac users.</p>
<p>I'm very glad I've had the opportunity to share this project with you all.</p>
<p>Sleep Well, and have fun!</p>
