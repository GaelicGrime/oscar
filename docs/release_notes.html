<h1><image src='qrc:/docs/sheep.png' width=64 height=64>SleepyHead v0.8.7</h1>

<p><b>Please Note:</b> <i>This is still pre-Beta software. Expect bugs.</i></p>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>

<p>I've been a little less functional that usual since last time (fog, headaches, appendicitus, etc.. bleh),
however, I have still managed to cook up a few nice improvements...</p>

<p><b>What's New?</b><br/>
<li>You can now Shift+Left Click on a day in an overview graph, and it will jump to that day in Daily tab.</li>
<li>New calendar navigation bar allows easy hiding the calendar to get more room.</li>
<li>(Relative) AHI is displayed above the flow rate waveform for selected area.</li>
<li>Improved support for ResMed S9 ASV/VPAP Machines.</li>
<li>Added some basic CSV export capabilities.</li>
<li>A new preference option to switch some daily graphs between square plots and normal line plots.</li>
<li>Some graphing optimizations to improve performance.</li>
<li>Quite a few other little bugfixes I've forgotten about.</li>
<br/>
<b>What's still missing/broken?</b><br/>
<li>Oximetry.. still mostly broken. I will eventually get around to it...</li>
<li>Daily report printing still needs doing.</li>
<li>Plenty more I'm sure of it..</li>
</p>
<p><b>Problems & Stuff?</b><br/>
If I've still missed your bug, my appologies, I'm not deliberately ignoring you, I'm just rather darn forgetful and need reminding.</p>
<p>SourceForge is still the best place to report bugs, especially to do with these binary builds. If your following GIT source, they mailing list is (usually) much quicker in getting my attention.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you experience a crash right after starting, you may need to manually remove the "SleepApp" folder, which resides under your documents directory.</p>
<p><b>Thanks</b><br/>
Thanks to all the wonderful people who have given their support to this project, be it via donations,
sharing CPAP data, following GIT source tree, testing binary builds, submitting bug reports, giving ideas for improvement, and general feedback on the CPAP forums.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate all the help and encouragement.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
