<p><b>Please Note:</b> <i>This is still pre-Beta software. Expect bugs.</i></p>

<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>

<p>This is by no means a "major" release, it mostly just fixes some annoying bugs.</p>
<p>I would have liked to have had more to share with you all by now, but I spent the last few
weeks flattened by fatigue & fog. Not fun, and not feeling all that productive.</p>
<p>Still, I have managed to make a few nice improvements...</p>

<p><b>Which bugs are fixed?</b><br/>
I can't remember. Quite a few import related issues where fixed.</p>
<b>Apart from the bugfixes, what's new?</b>
<li>Shift+Left Clicking on overview graph will open that day in Daily tab.</li>
<li>New calendar navigation bar allows easy hiding the calendar to get more room.</li>
<li>Also includes some minor optimizations.</li>
<br/>
<b>What's still missing/broken?</b><br/>
<li>Oximetry.. still. I know it sucks..</li>
<li>Daily report printing still needs doing</li>
<li>???</li>
</p>
<p><b>Problems & Stuff?</b><br/>
If I've still missed your bug, my appologies, I'm not deliberately ignoring you, I'm just rather darn forgetful and need reminding.</p>
<p>SourceForge is still the best place to report bugs, especially to do with these binary builds. If your following GIT source, they mailing list is (usually) much quicker in getting my attention.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you experience a crash right after starting, you may need to manually remove the "SleepApp" folder, which resides under your documents directory.</p>
<p><b>On Reviews</b><br/>
Thanks for the nice reviews at SourceForge, however please be mindful that this software isn't finished. </p>
<p>Reviewing (and testing) unfinished software is a lot like tasting unfermented beer: most of the raw ingredients are there, but it's flat and still missing it's kick.</p>
<p>I guess I can't complain about the 95%, I don't expect to be able to keep everybody happy.<br/>
But it shows there is always room for improvement. :)</p>
<p><b>Thanks</b><br/>
Thanks to all the wonderful people who have given their support to this project, be it via donations,
sharing CPAP data, following GIT source tree, testing binary builds, submitting bug reports, giving ideas for improvement, and general feedback on the CPAP forums.</p>
<p>I very much appreciate all the help and encouragement.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Mark Watkins (JediMark)</p>
