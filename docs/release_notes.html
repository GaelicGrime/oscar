<p><h2><b>Release Notes</b></h2></p>
<p>Hi There!</p>
<p>This is just a minor update, but it added some new functionality to the auto-updater.</p>
<b>New features & bugs fixes in this Update:</b></br>
<list>
<li>Auto-Updater test for Windows & Mac Platforms</li>
<li>Adds Total Leaks Overview chart for PRS1 Users.</li>
<li>Preliminary ZEO CSV Support, and simple SleepStage line graph</li>
<li>Fixes Overview AHI chart showing "No Data" on 0.00 days.</li>
<li>Fixes crash after using Preferences before importing first data.</li>
<li>Fixes first minute of Resp. Rate & Minute Vent calcs not showing data. (You will have to Data->Advanced->Purge CPAP Data and then reimport if you want this, as recalc won't do it)</li>
</list>
<p><b>Would you like to help test breaky stuff?</b></p>
<p>Advanced users who are willing, can now help test future updates, so we can hopefully avoid unleashing unintentonally buggy versions on everyone else.</p>
<p>There is an option in General Preferences that tells the updater to look at potentially breaky experimental & test builds.</p>
<p>If your experiencing a specific bug or problem I might occasionally ask you to switch this setting on so I can deliver a custom fix for you to test.</p>
<p>Please always read the release notes carefully before accepting an update with experimental/test builds switched on.</p>

<p><b>Sleep Well, and have fun!</b></p>
